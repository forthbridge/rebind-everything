[h1]Provides options for rebinding all Slugcat abilities, via Improved Input Config![/h1]

[h1]Instead of through the Remix config menu, configure this mod via the normal Input Settings under Options![/h1]

[b]Provides options to rebind all of the following:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Back Spears
    [*]Back Slugs
    [*]Artificer's Jump
    [*]Artificer's Parry
    [*]Gourmand & Artificer's Crafting
    [*]Spearmaster's Spear Extraction
    [*]Saint's Ascension
    [*]Aiming Saint's Ascension
    [*]Grappling (Tongue & Grapple Worm)
[/list]

[b]For any inputs left unbound, the default behavior is used![b]

[u][b]Improved Input Config may show a warning if multiple bindings share the same key, but otherwise the rebinds should still work perfectly fine in this case![/b][/u]
