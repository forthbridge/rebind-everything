# Provides options for rebinding all Slugcat abilities, via [Improved Input Config](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/improved-input-config)!

## Instead of through the Remix config menu, configure this mod via the normal Input Settings under Options!

## Manual Installation
You can find most workshop mods hosted on RainDB! (http://www.raindb.net/)
  
  They will be kept up to date, but are only updated on a roughly weekly basis, so unfortunately if a mod is new / recently updated, you may have to wait for the latest release!
